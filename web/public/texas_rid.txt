The use of the registry is for individual consumers to contact individual interpreters for interpreting assignments ONLY. These search results can change daily. To ensure the most accurate and up to date information, please DO NOT copy names and store them in an external database.


The additional language and specialities section is an opportunity for members to self identify their areas of expertise. RID does not endorse any of these skills and consumers are advised to use this feature as a guide in selecting an interpreter.
NOTE: If the member does not have "Freelance" status indicated, please do not contact them regarding assignments.
If you are looking to hire an interpreter keep the Category as Certified.
To search for other RID members, select a different Category.
